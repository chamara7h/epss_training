# What is forecasting?

## What is a `FORECAST`?

An estimation of the future based on all of the information available at the time when we generate the forecast;

- historical data,
- knowledge of any future events that might impact the forecasts.

## What is time series data?

- Time series consist of sequences of observations collected over time.
- Time series forecasting is estimating how the sequence of observations will continue into the future.

# Forecasting using R

## Loading libraries

We use the `fpp3` package in this workshop, which provides all the necessary packages for data manipulation, plotting, and forecasting.

```{r}
#| results: hide 

# Define required packages
packages <- c("tidyverse", "fable", "tsibble", "feasts", 'zoo')

# Install missing packages
missing_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(missing_packages)) {
  suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(install.packages(missing_packages)))
}

# Load libraries quietly
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages({
  library(tidyverse) # Data manipulation and plotting functions
  library(fable) # Time series manipulation
  library(tsibble) # Forecasting functions
  library(feasts) # Time series graphics and statistics
}))

```

Read more at [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.

## Preparing the data

In this workshop, we are using `tsibble` objects. They provide a data infrastructure for tidy temporal data with wrangling tools, adapting the [tidy data principles](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html).

In `tsibble`:

- **Index:** time information about the observation
- **Measured variable(s):** numbers of interest 
- **Key variable(s):** set of variables that define observational units over time
- It works with tidyverse functions.

## Read `csv` file

```{r}

med_qty <- read.csv('data/med_qty.csv')
med_qty |> head(10)

```


Do you think the `med_qty` data set is a tidy data?

## Check for `NA` and duplicates

```{r}
# check NAs

anyNA(med_qty)

```

```{r}
#check duplicates

med_qty |>  
  duplicated() |>  
  sum() 

```

## Create tsibble

```{r}

med_tsb <- med_qty |>  
  mutate(date = yearmonth(date)) |>  # convert chr to date format
  as_tsibble(index = date, key = c(hub_id, product_id))

med_tsb 

```

- What is the temporal granularity of `med_tsb`?
- How many time series do we have in `med_tsb`?

## Check temporal gaps (implicit missing values)

```{r}

has_gaps(med_tsb) |> head(3) #check gaps

scan_gaps(med_tsb) |> head(3) # show gaps

count_gaps(med_tsb) |> head(3) # count gaps

```

## Check temporal gaps (implicit missing values)

If there is any gap, then we fill it. 

```{r}

med_tsb |> fill_gaps(quantity_issued=0L) # we can fill it with zero

```

## Check temporal gaps (implicit missing values)

*Note:* Since the main focus of this study is to provide foundational knowledge on forecasting, we will filter out time series with many missing values and then fill the remaining gaps using `na.interp()` function [(Read more)](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/forecast/html/na.interp.html).

```{r}

item_ids <- med_tsb |> 
  count_gaps() |> 
  group_by(hub_id, product_id) |> 
  summarise(.n = max(.n), .groups = 'drop') |> 
  filter(.n  > 1) |> 
  mutate(id = paste0(hub_id,'-',product_id)) |> 
  pull(id) # filtering the item ids

med_tsb_filter <- med_tsb |> 
  mutate(id = paste0(hub_id,'-',product_id)) |> 
  group_by(hub_id, product_id) |>
  mutate(num_observations = n()) |> 
  filter(!id %in% item_ids & num_observations >59) |>   # we have cold starts and discontinuations. 
  fill_gaps(quantity_issued = 1e-6, .full = TRUE) |>   # Replace NAs with a small value
  select(-id, -num_observations) |> 
  mutate(quantity_issued = if_else(is.na(quantity_issued), 
                                   exp(
                                     forecast::na.interp(
                                     ts(log(quantity_issued), frequency = 12))), 
                                   quantity_issued))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false

med_tsb_filter |> 
  write.csv('data/med_tsb_filter.csv', row.names = FALSE)


```


## Data wrangaling using `tsibble`

We can use the `filter()` function to select rows.

```{r}

med_tsb |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_10') 

```

## Data wrangaling using `tsibble`

We can use the `select()` function to select columns.

```{r}

med_tsb |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_10') |> 
  select(date, product_id, quantity_issued)

```

## Data wrangaling using `tsibble`

We can use `group_by()` function to group over keys. We can use the `summarise()` function to summarise over keys.

```{r}

med_tsb |> 
  group_by(product_id) |> 
  summarise(total_quantity_issued = sum(quantity_issued), .groups = 'drop')

```

## Data wrangaling using `tsibble`

We can use the `mutate()` function to create new variables.

```{r}

med_tsb |> 
  mutate(quarter = yearquarter(date))

```

## Data wrangaling using `tsibble`

We can use `index_by()` function to group over index We can use the `summarise()` function to summarise over index.

```{r}

med_tsb |> 
  mutate(quarter = yearquarter(date)) |> 
  index_by(quarter) |> 
  summarise(total_quantity_issues = sum(quantity_issued))

```

# Now it is your `turn`.

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown::countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 00)
```

# Explore your data

## Time series patterns

- `Level`: The level of a time series describes the center of the series.
- `Trend`: A trend describes predictable increases or decreases in the level of a series.
- `Seasonal`: Seasonality is a consistent pattern that repeats over a fixed cycle. pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week).
- `Cyclic`: A pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period (duration usually of at least 2 years).

## Time series patterns


```{r}
#| echo: false

# Generate sample data
days <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2015-01-01"), to = as.Date("2025-01-01"), by = "month")

# Components
level <- 100  # Constant level
trend <- seq(1, length(days), by = 1)  # Increasing trend
seasonality <- 10 * sin(2 * pi * month(days) / 12)  # Seasonal effect
cycle <- 15 * sin(2 * pi * (1:length(days)) / (12 * 4))  # Cyclic pattern (longer than seasonality)
random_noise <- rnorm(length(days), mean = 0, sd = 5)  # Random noise

ts_data <- data.frame(
  Date = days,
  Actual = level + trend + seasonality + cycle + random_noise,
  Level = mean(level + trend + seasonality + cycle + random_noise),
  Trend = level + trend,
  Seasonal = level + trend + seasonality,
  Cyclic = level + trend + seasonality + cycle
) |>  
  pivot_longer(cols = -Date, names_to = "Component", values_to = "Value")  |> 
  mutate(Component = factor(Component, levels = c("Actual", "Level", "Trend", "Seasonal", "Cyclic")))

# Determine cycle start dates
cycle_start_dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2015-01-01"), to = as.Date("2025-01-01"), by = "4 years")

# Plot
ggplot(ts_data, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Component, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Value") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

## Additive vs. multiplicative seasonality

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Simulate example time series data with additive and multiplicative seasonality
set.seed(123)
time <- seq(1, 100, by = 1)
additive_seasonality <- 10 + 5*sin(2*pi*time/12) + rnorm(100, 0, 2)
multiplicative_seasonality <- (1 + 0.05*time) * (1 + 0.5*sin(2*pi*time/12)) * rnorm(100, 1, 0.1)

data <- data.frame(Time = time, Additive = additive_seasonality, Multiplicative = multiplicative_seasonality)

# Convert data to long format
data_long <- data |> pivot_longer(cols = c(Additive, Multiplicative), names_to = "Seasonality", values_to = "Value")

# Plotting using ggplot2
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Time, y = Value)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~Seasonality, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

- When we have multiplicative seasonality, we can use transformations to convert multiplicative seasonality into additive seasonality. 
- In this training, we are not discussing time series transformations. You can read more about it at [Transformations and adjustments](https://otexts.com/fpp3/transformations.html).


## Time plots

You can create time plot using `autoplot()` function.

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_2') |> 
  autoplot(quantity_issued) +
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Quantity Issued"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Are time plots best?

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  mutate(id = paste0(hub_id, product_id)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = quantity_issued, group = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Quantity Issued"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))


```
  
## Seasonal plots

- Data plotted against the individual `seasons` in which the data were observed (In this case a “season” is a month).
- Enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen more clearly, and also allows any substantial departures from the seasonal pattern to be easily identified.
- You can create seasonal plots using `gg_season()` function.

## Seasonal plots

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_14' & product_id == 'product_5') |> 
  gg_season(quantity_issued, labels = "both") +
  ylab("Quantity issued") +
  ggtitle("Seasonal plot") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Seasonal sub series plots

- Data for each season collected together in time plot as separate time series.
- Enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly, and changes in seasonality over time to be visualized.
- You can create seasonal sub series plots using `gg_subseries()` function.

## Seasonal sub series plots

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_14' & product_id == 'product_5') |> 
  gg_subseries(quantity_issued) +
  ylab("Quantity issued") +
  ggtitle("Seasonal sub series plot") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Strength of seasonality and trend

- We used STL decomposition for additive decompositions.
- A multiplicative decomposition can be obtained by first taking logs of the data, then back-transforming the components. 
- Decompositions that are between additive and multiplicative can be obtained using a Box-Cox transformation of the data.
- Read more at [STL decomposition](https://otexts.com/fpp3/stl.html).

## Strength of seasonality and trend   

**STL Decomposition**

$$
y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t
$$

**Seasonal Strength**

$$
\max \left( 0, 1 - \frac{\text{Var}(R_t)}{\text{Var}(S_t + R_t)} \right)
$$

**Trend Strength**

$$
\max \left( 0, 1 - \frac{\text{Var}(R_t)}{\text{Var}(T_t + R_t)} \right)
$$

## Feature extraction and statistics

We can use `features()` function to extract the strength of trend and seasonality.

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  features(quantity_issued, feat_stl)

```


## Feature extraction and statistics

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  features(quantity_issued, feat_stl) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = trend_strength, y = seasonal_strength_year, shape = product_id)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  ylab("Seasonal strength") +
  xlab("Trend strength") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Lag plots and autocorrelation

- Each graph shows $y_t$  plotted against $y_{t-k}$ for different values of $k$.  
- The `autocorrelations` are the correlations associated with these scatterplots: $\text{Corr}(y_t, y_{t-k})$
- You can create lag plots using `gglag()` function.
- These values indicate the relationship between current and past observations in a time series.

## Lag plots and autocorrelation


```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_14' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  gg_lag(quantity_issued, lags = 1:12, geom='point') +
  ylab("Quantity issued") +
  xlab("Lag (Quantity issued, n)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
         panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Autocorrelation

- `Autocovariance` and `autocorrelation`: measure linear relationship between `lagged values` of a time series y.
- We denote the `sample autocovariance` at lag $k$ by $c_k$ and the `sample autocorrelation` at lag $k$ by $r_k$. Then, we define:

$c_k = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=k+1}^{T} (y_t - \bar{y})(y_{t-k} - \bar{y})$

$r_k = \frac{c_k}{c_0}$

where $c_0$ is the variance of the time series.

- $r_1$ indicates how successive values of $y$ relate to each other.
- $r_2$ indicates how $y$ values two periods apart relate to each other.
- $r_k$ is almost the same as the `sample correlation` between $y_t$ and $y_{t-k}$.

## Autocorrelation

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_14' & product_id == 'product_5') |> 
  ACF(quantity_issued, lag_max = 24)

```

## Autocorrelation

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_14' & product_id == 'product_5') |> 
  ACF(quantity_issued, lag_max = 36) |> 
  autoplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

What autocorrelation will tell us? Which key features could be highlighted by ACF?

## Autocorrelation

- When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive.
- When data are seasonal, the autocorrelations will be larger at the seasonal lags (i.e., at multiples of the seasonal frequency) 
- When data are trended and seasonal, you see a combination of these effects.

# Forecast modelling

## Naive

Simplest forecasting method using last observation as forecast.

$\hat{y}_{t+h|t} = y_t$

**Assumptions**

- No systematic pattern in data
- Recent observations are most relevant

**Strengths & Weaknesses**

<span style="color:green;">✓ Simple benchmark model</span>  
<span style="color:green;">✓ Requires no computation</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Ignores all patterns</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Poor for trending/seasonal data</span>  

## Naive

We use `NAIVE()`  function and `model()` function to build the Naive model. 

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(naive = NAIVE(quantity_issued)) |> 
  forecast(h = 12) |> 
  autoplot(med_tsb_filter |> 
             filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5'), level = NULL) +
  labs(y = "Quantity issued", x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Seasonal NAIVE (sNAIVE)

$y_{t+h \mid t} = y_{t+h - m(k+1)}$

Where: $m$ = seasonal period and $k = \lfloor \frac{h-1}{m} \rfloor$

**Assumptions**

- Seasonal pattern is stable
- No trend present

**Strengths & Weaknesses**

<span style="color:green;">✓ Handles strong seasonality</span>  
<span style="color:green;">✓ Simple interpretation</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Fails with changing seasonality</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Ignores non-seasonal patterns</span>  


## sNaive

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(snaive = SNAIVE(quantity_issued ~ lag("year"))) |> 
  forecast(h = 12) |> 
  autoplot(med_tsb_filter |> 
             filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5'), level = NULL) +
  labs(y = "Quantity issued", x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Mean 

Uses the historical average of all observations as forecast.

$y_{t+h \mid t} = \bar{y} = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{i=1}^{t} y_i$

Where: $t$ is the number of past observations used for the forecast.

**Assumptions**

- Series is stationary
- Short-term fluctuations are noise

**Strengths & Weaknesses**

<span style="color:green;">✓ Effective noise reduction</span>  
<span style="color:green;">✓ Simple to implement</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Ignores all patterns</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Lags behind trends</span>   

## Mean

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(MEAN(quantity_issued ~ window(size = 3))) |> 
  forecast(h = 12) |> 
  autoplot(med_tsb_filter |> 
             filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5'), level = NULL) +
  labs(y = "Quantity issued", x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## ARIMA

Combines Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) components with differencing.

- `AR`: autoregressive (lagged observations as inputs)
- `I`: integrated (differencing to make series stationary)
- `MA`: moving average (lagged errors as inputs)

<br>

The ARIMA model is given by:

$(1 - \phi_1 B - \dots - \phi_p B^p)(1 - B)^d y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 B + \dots + \theta_q B^q) \epsilon_t$

Where: $B$: Backshift operator, $\phi$: AR coefficients, $\theta$: MA coefficients, $d$: Differencing order, $p$: AR order, $q$: MA order and $\epsilon_t$: White noise 

## ARIMA

**Assumptions**

- Series is stationary
- Linear relationship between past values and errors
- White noise errors
- No missing values in series

**Strengths & Weaknesses**

<span style="color:green;">✓ Flexible for various time series patterns</span>  
<span style="color:green;">✓ Perform well for short term horizons</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Requires stationarity for optimal performance</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ The parameters are often not easily interpretable in terms of trend or seasonality</span>  

## ARIMA

A `stationary series` is:

- roughly horizontal  
- constant variance  
- no patterns predictable in the long-term

  * $m$: number of observations per year.
  * $d$: first differences, $D$: seasonal differences
  * $p$: AR lags, $q$: MA lags
  * $P$: seasonal AR lags, $Q$: seasonal MA lags

Seasonal and non-seasonal terms combine multiplicatively.

## ARIMA automatic modelling

- Plot the data. Identify any unusual observations.
- If necessary, transform the data (e.g., Box-Cox transformation) to stabilize the variance.
- Use `ARIMA()` to automatically select a model.
- Check the residuals from your chosen model and if they do not look like white noise, try a modified model.
- Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.

## ARIMA automatic modelling

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(ARIMA(quantity_issued)) |>

## ETS

ETS stands for Exponential Smoothing and is based on a state space framework that decomposes a time series into three components:

| General Notation |  | E T S | **`E`**xponen**`T`**ial **`S`**moothing |
|------------------|--|-------|-----------------------------------|
|                 | ↗  | ↑     | ↖                                 |
|                 | **`E`**rror | **`T`**rend | **`S`**eason |


- `E`rror: Additive (`"A"`) or multiplicative (`"M"`)
- `T`rend: None (`"N"`), additive (`"A"`), multiplicative (`"M"`), or damped (`"Ad"` or `"Md"`).
- `S`easonality: None (`"N"`), additive (`"A"`) or multiplicative (`"M"`)

<br>
For example, `ETS(A,N,N)` is the simple exponential smoothing model (no trend or seasonality) with additive errors.

## ETS

How do we combine these elements?

`Additively`?

$y_t = \ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + s_{t-m} + \varepsilon_t$

<br>

`Multiplicatively`?

$y_t = \ell_{t-1}b_{t-1}s_{t-m}(1 + \varepsilon_t)$

<br>

Perhaps `a mix of both`?

$y_t = (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) s_{t-m} + \varepsilon_t$

## ETS

How do the level, trend and seasonal components evolve over time?

![](images/pegel1.png){fig-align="center"}

## ETS

**Assumptions**

- Decomposable patterns
- Recent observations more important
- Consistent error structure (additive/multiplicative)

**Strengths & Weaknesses**

<span style="color:green;">✓ They can be adapted to various data characteristics with different error, trend, and seasonal formulations</span>  
<span style="color:green;">✓ Often very effective when the underlying components are stable</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ Parameter estimates (including smoothing parameters and initial states) can affect the forecasts</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ SMay struggle to capture sudden shifts or non-standard patterns if the smoothing parameters are constant</span>  

## ETS automatic modelling

- Apply each model that is appropriate to the data.
- Optimize parameters and initial values using MLE (or some other criterion).
- Select best method using AICc.
- Use `ETS()` to automatically select a model.
- Produce forecasts using best method.

## ETS automatic modelling

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(ETS(quantity_issued)) |> 
  forecast(h = 12) |> 
  autoplot(med_tsb_filter |> 
             filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5'), level = NULL) +
  labs(y = "Quantity issued", x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Model fitting in `Fable`

- The `model()` function trains models on data.
- It returns a `mable` object.
- A `mable` is a model table, each cell corresponds to a fitted model.

```{r}

# Fit the models

fit_all <- med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(
    naive = NAIVE(quantity_issued),
    snaive = SNAIVE(quantity_issued ~ lag('year')),
    mean = MEAN(quantity_issued ~ window(size = 3)),
    arima = ARIMA(quantity_issued),
    ets = ETS(quantity_issued)
    )

fit_all

```

## Extract information from `mable`

```{r}
#| eval: false

fit_all  |>  select(snaive) |>  report()
fit_all |>  tidy()
fit_all  |>  glance()

```

- The `report()` function gives a formatted model-specific display.
- The `tidy()` function is used to extract the coefficients from the models.
- We can extract information about some specific model using the `filter()` and `select()`functions.

## Producing forecasts

- The `forecast()` function is used to produce forecasts from estimated models.
- `h` can be specified with:
    * a number (the number of future observations)
    * natural language (the length of time to predict)
    * provide a dataset of future time periods
    

## Producing forecasts

```{r}

fit_all_fc <- fit_all |> 
  forecast(h = 'year')

#h = "year" is equivalent to setting h = 12.

fit_all_fc

```

## Visualising forecasts

```{r}

fit_all_fc |> 
  autoplot(level = NULL) +
  autolayer(med_tsb_filter |> 
              filter_index("2022 JAn" ~ .) |> 
              filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5'), color = 'black') +
  labs(title = "Forecasts for monthly quantity issued", y = "Quantity issued", x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA)) +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast"))

## What is wrong with point forecasts?

A point forecast is a single-value prediction representing the most likely future outcome, based on current data and models.

The disadvantage of point forecast;

<span style="color:red;">✗ It ignores additional information in future.</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ It does not explain uncertainties around future.</span>  
<span style="color:red;">✗ It can not deal with assymmetric.</span>  

## Types of probabilistic forecasts

`Interval forecasts`: A prediction interval is an interval within which power generation may lie, with a certain probability.

![](images/interval_fc.png){fig-align="center"}

## Types of probabilistic forecasts

`Quantile forecasts`: A quantile forecast provides a value that the future observation is expected to be below with a specified probability.

![](images/quantile_fc.png){fig-align="center"}

## Types of probabilistic forecasts

`Distribution forecasts`: A	comprehensive	probabilistic	forecast	capturing	the	full	range	of	potential	outcomes across all time horizons.

![](images/density_fc.png){fig-align="center"}

## Types of probabilistic forecasts

`Scenario forecasts`: A spectrum of potential futures derived from probabilistic modeling to inform decision- making under uncertainty.

![](images/scenario_fc.png){fig-align="center"}

## Forecast distributions from `bootstrapping`

When a normal distribution for the residuals is an unreasonable assumption, one alternative is to use `bootstrapping`, which only assumes that the residuals are uncorrelated with constant variance.

- A one-step forecast error is defined as 

$e_t = y_t - \hat{y}_{t|t-1}$, $y_t = \hat{y}_{t|t-1} + e_t$

- So we can simulate the next observation of a time series using

$y_{T+1} = \hat{y}_{T+1|T} + e_{T+1}$

- Adding the new simulated observation to our data set, we can repeat the process to obtain 

$y_{T+2} = \hat{y}_{T+2|T+1} + e_{T+2}$

## Generate different futures forecast

```{r}
#| eval: false

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(snaive = SNAIVE(quantity_issued ~ lag("year"))) |> 
  generate(h = 12, bootstrap = TRUE, times = 5)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

sim <- med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(snaive = SNAIVE(quantity_issued ~ lag("year"))) |> 
  generate(h = 12, bootstrap = TRUE, times = 5)

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter_index('2022 Jan' ~ .) |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = quantity_issued)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .sim, colour = as.factor(.rep)),
    data = sim)+
  labs(y = "Quantity issued", x = "Date", colour="Future") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "lightgrey", fill = NA))

```

## Generate probabilistic forecast

```{r}

  model(snaive = SNAIVE(quantity_issued ~ lag("year"))) |> 
  forecast(h = 12, bootstrap = TRUE, times = 1000)

```

## Prediction intervals

Forecast intervals can be extracted using the `hilo()` function.

```{r}

med_tsb_filter |> 
  filter(hub_id == 'hub_1' & product_id == 'product_5') |>
  model(snaive = SNAIVE(quantity_issued ~ lag("year"))) |> 
  forecast(h = 12, bootstrap = TRUE, times = 1000) |> 
  hilo(level = 75) |> 
  unpack_hilo("75%")

```

# Now it is your `turn`.

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown::countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 00)
```

# Evaluating the model performances

## Forecast accuracy evaluation using test sets

* We mimic the real life situation
* We pretend we don't know some part of data (new data)
* It must not be used for `any` aspect of model training
* Forecast accuracy is computed only based on the test set

`Training and test sets`

```{r traintest, fig.height=1, echo=FALSE}
train <- 1:18
test <- 19:24
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(0, 0, xlim = c(0, 26), ylim = c(0, 2), xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", type = "n")
arrows(0, 0.5, 25, 0.5, 0.05)
points(train, train * 0 + 0.5, pch = 19, col = "#0072B2")
points(test, test * 0 + 0.5, pch = 19, col = "#D55E00")
text(26, 0.5, "time")
text(10, 1, "Training data", col = "#0072B2")
text(21, 1, "Test data", col = "#D55E00")
```

## Evaluating `point forecast` accuracy

- In order to evaluate the performance of a forecasting model, we compute its forecast  accuracy.
- Forecast accuracy is compared by measuring errors based on the test set.
- Ideally it should allow comparing benefits from improved accuracy with the cost of obtaining the improvement.

## Evaluating `point forecast` accuracy

**Forecast Error**

$e_{T+h} = y_{T+h} - \hat{y}_{T+h\mid T}$

where  
- $y_{T+h}$ is the $(T+h)^\text{th}$ observation $(h=1,\dots,H)$, and  
- $\hat{y}_{T+h\mid T}$ is the forecast based on data up to time $T$.

## Evaluating `probabilistic forecast` accuracy

`Coverage`

- Measures how often the true value falls within a prediction interval
- Typically assessed for specific confidence levels (e.g., 95% interval)

Example: A 95% prediction interval should contain the true value 95% of the time.

```{r}
#| echo: false

y_true <- sin(x * 0.1) + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 0.1)

# Compute prediction intervals for "good" and "poor" coverage
lower_good <- y_pred - 0.3

## Evaluating `probabilistic forecast` accuracy

`Sharpness`

- Refers to the width of prediction intervals
- Measures how precise or focused the forecast is

*Example*: A forecast predicting monthly sales qty between 2500-5000 is sharper than 500-10000.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Load required libraries
library(gridExtra)

# Generate the data
x <- 0:49
y_pred <- sin(x * 0.2)

# Compute prediction intervals
# Sharp intervals
lower_sharp <- y_pred - 0.2
upper_sharp <- y_pred + 0.2

# Wide intervals
lower_wide <- y_pred - 0.6
upper_wide <- y_pred + 0.6

# Create a data frame with the variables
data <- data.frame(
  x = x,
  y_pred = y_pred,
  lower_sharp = lower_sharp,
  upper_sharp = upper_sharp,
  lower_wide = lower_wide,
  upper_wide = upper_wide
)

# Plot for Sharp Intervals
plot_sharp <- ggplot(data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_sharp, ymax = upper_sharp), fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(y = y_pred), color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Sharp Intervals", y = "Predicted Value") +
  theme_minimal() +

```

## Evaluating `probabilistic forecast` accuracy

`Quantile score/ Pin ball loss`

- Assesses entire prediction interval, not just point forecast
- Penalizes too narrow and too wide intervals
- Interpretation: Lower values indicate better calibrated intervals

$$
Q_{p,t} =
\begin{cases} 
2(1 - p)(f_{p,t} - y_t), & \text{if } y_t < f_{p,t}, \\[1mm]
2p(y_t - f_{p,t}),       & \text{if } y_t \geq f_{p,t}.
\end{cases}
$$

## Evaluating `probabilistic forecast` accuracy

`CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score)`

- Proper scoring rule
- Measures accuracy of full predictive distribution
- Generalizes absolute error to probabilistic forecasts
- Interpretation: Lower CRPS = better forecast
- Advantage: Sensitive to distance, rewards sharp and calibrated forecasts


$\large \text{CRPS} = \text{mean}(p_j),$

where

$p_j = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(G_j(x) - F_j(x)\right)^2dx,$

## XGBoost

[Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/glossary/xgboost/) is a scalable tree-based gradient boosting machine learning algorithm.

$\hat{y}_{t+h|t} = \sum_{k=1}^K f_k(\mathbf{x}_t), \quad f_k \in \mathcal{F}$

Where: $K$ = number of trees, $f_k$ = tree function, $\mathbf{x}_t$ = feature vector (lags, calendar features, etc.)
